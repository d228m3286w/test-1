			<h2>But the Force is So Much More Badass</h2>
				<p>I really just hope you can read all this text and now I will quote Dylan Thomas: <br>
						Do not go gentle into that good night,<br>
						Old age should burn and rave at close of day;<br>
						Rage, rage against the dying of the light.<br>

						Though wise men at their end know dark is right,<br>
						Because their words had forked no lightning they<br>
						Do not go gentle into that good night.<br>

						Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright<br>
						Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,<br>
						Rage, rage against the dying of the light.<br>

						Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,<br>
						And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way,<br>
						Do not go gentle into that good night.<br>

						Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight<br>
						Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay,<br>
						Rage, rage against the dying of the light.<br>

						And you, my father, there on that sad height,<br>
						Curse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray.<br>
						Do not go gentle into that good night.<br>
						Rage, rage against the dying of the light.<br>
